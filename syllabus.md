Important websites
------------------

-  [Canvas site](https://stats604.org). We will use Canvas to manage assignment submissions, peer review, and grading. For all other course-related matters, please use Slack.
-  [Slack channel](https://um-fa23-stats604.slack.com/ssb/signin_redirect?s=1&v=4.33.90&ssb_vid=.ac1db12833a48f1c7484fd5df3b39cae&ssb_instance_id=72737c8c-61fd-4c29-80c8-97a72b6f37a8). Please post any sort of questions about the homework assignments, projects, exams, and/or lectures to Slack, so other members of the class can view the responses and participate. My response time to Slack DMs is generally better than to e-mails.

What this class is about
------------------------

From the course catalog:

> This course studies the process of statistical investigation. Students will learn to formulate scientific and statistical questions, analyze relevant data, and clearly communicate their findings. The emphasis is not on specific methods, but rather on scientific reasoning, collaboration, communication, and critical evaluation of findings. The course will be project based, using case studies from collaborative research and consulting. Key components of the course include: question formulation, data collection and study design, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, model selection and validation, assessment of findings, post-hoc analysis, and conclusions, writing, communication and critical assessment, and reproducibility and replicability.

Somewhat more concretely, here are five skills that I hope to instill you in this class:

1.  How to appropriately formulate and test a scientific hypothesis using the available data.
2.  How to effectively communicate statistical findings, including to non-statisticians.
3.  How to create documented, reproducible analyses.
4.  How to give and receive constructive criticism.
5.  How to habitually, efficiently, and critically read research papers.

Schedule
--------

- Tuesday and Thursday lectures will follow different "tracks".
	- Tuesdays will focus more on applied statistical reasoning, and will roughly follow the textbook. Especially in the second half of the semester, the Tuesday lectures will be devoted to discussing and critically analyzing applied papers. 
	- The Thursday lectures will focus more on the active "doing" of statistics, and will be largely project based. Thursday lectures will also be used to develop presentation and other communication skills, as well as to discuss issues of reproducibility and replicability. 
- The focus of the lab session (on Wednesday) will vary from week to week, and will be used to reinforce concepts and skills from both Tuesday and Thursday lectures.
- Readings have been uploaded to Perusall for your convenience.

Grading
-------

|   Component   |     Weight     |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
|  Projects 1-3 | 30% (10% each) |
| Final Project |       20%      |
|    Midterm    |       20%      |
|   Homeworks   |       15%      |
| Participation |       15%      |

- Projects:
	- Projects 1-3 each will take ~3 weeks.
	-   Final Project will take ~5 weeks.
	-   You'll work in randomly-assigned groups of 3-4 (different for each project).
	-   Your grade for each project will be based on a peer-reviewed writeup, _plus_ an in-class presentation.
- Homeworks
	- There will be about five homework assignments which focus mostly on the material covered Tuesday lectures.
	- These will be staggered so as not to overlap too much with the projects.
- Midterm:
	- There will be an in-class midterm on.
	- Closed-book, no notes. You may use a calculator.
- Participation
	- You are expected to participate meaningfully in class discussions. 
	- (Which requires you to do the reading ahead of time.)
	- Your participation grade will be determined holistically at the end of the semester. 
	- **The participation grade is _not_ "free points".**


Advice for success
----------------
- The projects are time-consuming. Get started on them as early as possible and do not put them off until the last minute. 
- Do the reading. Especially in the second half of the semester, when we will be critically evaluating applied papers during lecture. In particular, it is essential do the reading so that you can ...
- Participate in class discussions. The 15% of your grade that comes from participation will be taken seriously and is **not** just "freebie points."

-   **Ask questions**. Attend office hours. The professor and the GSI are there to help!


Academic Honesty
----------------

You are expected to abide by academic honesty standards set forth by the department and the graduate school. In particular, there is a **zero-tolerance** policy towards plagiarism of any form.
