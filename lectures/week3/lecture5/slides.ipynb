In the subdistricts enumerated in the above table as being supplied by both Companies, the mixing of the supply is of the most intimate kind.  The pipes of each Company go down all the streets, and into nearly all the courts and alleys.  **A few houses are supplied by one Company and a few by the other**, according to the decision of the owner or occupier at that time when the Water Companies were in active competition.  In many cases a single house has a supply different from that on either side.  **Each company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small**; there is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving the water of the different Companies."
